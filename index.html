          <br>
          <h2>High-School volunteering</h2>
          <p>In high school we had a volunteering program - every student had to volunteer a number of hours a week. I was in charge of my class students vulonteering. In addition to being the connecting chain between the students and the teacher responsible for the program ,  I was responsible on their volunteering hours and finding places that they can volunteer in.</p>
          
          <h2>A Smile Of Hope - "بسمة أمل"</h2>
          
          <p>ِA Smile Of Hope is an orginization that aims for drawing smiles on the faces of kids with cancer. I had the pleasure to volunteer in this orginization for almost a year , we used to visit to hospitals to do some fun activities with kids there to reconnect them with being kids. It was an amazing experience. </p>
          
          
          <h2>Rehabilitation Work Center - מע"ש</h2>
          <p>MAA`s(מע"ש) is an institue that provides a working place for people with disabilities. I have volunteered in this institute for almost half a year , I used to accompany the apprentices to help them if they needed and to connect with them. </p>
   
          <h2>Project Sunshine</h2>
          <p>Recently I have joined Project Sunshine , wich also aims to disconnect kids with cancer from the hospital`s atmosphere and to remind them of what is being an ordinary kid. I hope that I will fulfill Those things as much as possible and to be a vital member in the orginization. </p>
